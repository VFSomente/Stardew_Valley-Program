This is my first program made in Python, my first creation, made with basic programming concepts. It was done through an idea I had playing the game "Stardew Valley", where I had the task of knowing the value of fish eggs to get an idea of ​​which would be more valuable economically speaking. Then it came to my mind: "What if someone needs this information?" With that in mind, I created this program, I hope you like it!
